I would first like to thank my supervisor, Dirk. The door to your office was always open, whether I needed help with my research or just to have a chat. You consistently encouraged me to take initiative and make this research not only a reflection of my hard work, but also of my character. I am truly grateful for that.

Thank you to Prof du Toit and Prof Kruger for your constant feedback and motivation. My illustrative example has finally come to fruition.

Endless thanks, from the bottom of my heart, goes to my amazing family. All of those times that I said to you, "I think I've figured it out" actually mean something now.
