abstract = {In recent years there has been exponential growth in the use of biometrics for user authentication applications because biometrics-based authentication offers several advantages over knowledge and possession-based methods such as password/PIN-based systems. However, it is important that biometrics-based authentication systems be designed to withstand different sources of attacks on the system when employed in security-critical applications. This is even more important for unattended remote applications such as e-commerce. In this paper we outline the potential security holes in a biometrics-based authentication scheme, quantify the numerical strength of one method of fingerprint matching, then discuss how to combat some of the remaining weaknesses.},

@article{Teoh2004,
abstract = {Human authentication is the security task whose job is to limit access to physical locations or computer network only to those with authorisation. This is done by equipped authorised users with passwords, tokens or using their biometrics. Unfortunately, the first two suffer a lack of security as they are easy being forgotten and stolen; even biometrics also suffers from some inherent limitation and specific security threats. A more practical approach is to combine two or more factor authenticator to reap benefits in security or convenient or both. This paper proposed a novel two factor authenticator based on iterated inner products between tokenised pseudo-random number and the user specific fingerprint feature, which generated from the integrated wavelet and Fourier–Mellin transform, and hence produce a set of user specific compact code that coined as BioHashing. BioHashing highly tolerant of data capture offsets, with same user fingerprint data resulting in highly correlated bitstrings. Moreover, there is no deterministic way to get the user specific code without having both token with random data and user fingerprint feature. This would protect us for instance against biometric fabrication by changing the user specific credential, is as simple as changing the token containing the random data. The BioHashing has significant functional advantages over solely biometrics i.e. zero equal error rate point and clean separation of the genuine and imposter populations, thereby allowing elimination of false accept rates without suffering from increased occurrence of false reject rates.},

These methods have significant functional advantages over sole biometrics i.e. zero equal error rate. The main drawback of the base BioHashing method proposed in the literature relies in exhibiting low performance when an " impostor " B steals the pseudo-random numbers of A and he tries to authenticate as A. In this paper, we introduce some ideas to improve the base BioHashing approach in order to maintain a very low equal error rate when nobody steals the Hash key, and to reach good performance also when an " impostor " steals the Hash key.},

abstract = {3. Explanation: This Standard specifies four secure hash algorithms -SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 -for computing a condensed representation of electronic data (message). When a message of any length {\textless} 2 64 bits (for SHA-1 and SHA-256) or {\textless} 2 128 bits (for SHA-384 and SHA-512) is input to an algorithm, the result is an output called a message digest. The message digests range in length from 160 to 512 bits, depending on the algorithm. Secure hash algorithms are typically used with other cryptographic algorithms, such as digital signature algorithms and keyed-hash message authentication codes, or in the generation of random numbers (bits). The four hash algorithms specified in this standard are called secure because, for a given algorithm, it is computationally infeasible 1) to find a message that corresponds to a given message digest, or 2) to find two different messages that produce the same message digest. Any change to a message will, with a very high probability, result in a different message digest. This will result in a verification failure when the secure hash algorithm is used with a digital signature algorithm or a keyed-hash message authentication algorithm.},

Using a two-block approach we are able to turn a semi-free-start collision into a collision for 31 steps with a complexity of at most 2 65.5 . The main improvement of our work is to extend the size of the local collisions used in these attacks. To construct differential characteristics and confirming message pairs for longer local collisions, we had to improve the search strategy of our automated search tool. To test the limits of our techniques we present a semi-free-start collision for 38 steps.},

abstract = { This paper focuses on a coding approach for effective analysis and design of secure watermark-based multimedia authentication systems. We provide a design framework for semi-fragile watermark-based authentication such that both objectives of robustness and fragility are effectively controlled and achieved. Robustness and fragility are characterized as two types of authentication errors. The authentication embedding and verification structures of the semi-fragile schemes are derived and implemented using lattice codes to minimize these errors. Based on the specific security requirements of authentication, cryptographic techniques are incorporated to design a secure authentication code structure. Using nested lattice codes, a new approach, called MSB-LSB decomposition, is proposed which we show to be more secure than previous methods. Tradeoffs between authentication distortion and implementation efficiency of the secure authentication code are also investigated. Simulations of semi-fragile authentication methods on real images demonstrate the effectiveness of the MSB-LSB approach in simultaneously achieving security, robustness, and fragility objectives.},

abstract = {Biometric analysis for identifying verification is becoming a widespread reality. It is a very challenging and tedious task to develop a biometric template protection scheme which is anonymous, revocable and noninvertible while maintaining decent performance. Cancellable biometrics is one of the best methods used to resolve this problem. In this paper, a new method called as BioHashing which follows the technique of cancellable biometrics in the fingerprint domain is proposed. This proposed method does not require the re-alignment of fingerprints as all the minutiae are translated into a pre-defined two dimensional space based on a reference minutia. After that, the proposed Biohashing method is used to enforce the one-way property (non-invertibility) of the biometric template. The proposed approach is very much resistant to minor translation error and rotation distortion. An Equal Error Rates (EER) of less than 1{\%} is achieved in this approach and performance of the approach is also significant.},

However, their se-curity analysis either ignores the distribution of biometric features or uses inefficient feature matching. This usually leads to unrealistic estimates of security. In this paper we introduce a new measure of non-invertibility, called the Coverage-Effort (CE) curve which mea-sures the number of guesses (Effort) required by an adversary to re-cover a certain fraction (Coverage) of the original biometric data. In addition to utilizing the feature distribution, the CE curve allows esti-mation of security against partial recovery of biometric features. We analyze the CE curves obtained using different instances of a mix-ture of Gaussians based feature transform for fingerprint templates. Our analysis shows that knowledge of the fingerprint minutiae dis-tribution reduces the effort required to obtain a specified coverage.},

abstract = {Biometric technology is used for automatic personal recognition based on biological traits— fingerprint, iris, face, palm print, hand geometry, vascular pattern, voice—or behavioral characteristics—gait, signature, typing pattern. Fingerprinting is the oldest of these methods and has been utilized for over a century by law enforcement officials who use these distinctive characteristics to keep track of criminals. The National Science and Technology Council provides the following overview of biometric system components: " A typical biometric system is comprised of five integrated components: A sensor is used to collect the data and convert the information to a digital format. Signal processing algorithms perform quality control activities and develop the biometric template. A data storage component keeps information that new biometric templates will be compared to. A matching algorithm compares the new biometric template to one or more templates kept in data storage. Finally, a decision process (either automated or human-assisted) uses the results from the matching component to make a system-level decision. " [1] Authentication systems can be based on three measures: what you know-a password, what you have-a token or passcard, or what you are-biometrics. Passwords, keys and tokens can be forgotten, lost, stolen or otherwise compromised. Biometric identifiers also carry risks. Engineering professor, Tsutomu Matsumoto, demonstrated this point by using a digital camera, a PC, and gelatin to fashion a fake finger which fooled biometric scanners 80{\%} of the time. [2] However, new applications can detect fakes by identifying sweat pores, measuring conduction properties, and determining the differences in how a live finger and a dummy finger deform the surface of a sensor.

abstract = {Biometric cryptosystems and cancelable biometrics are both practical and promising schemes to enhance the security and privacy of biometric systems. Though a number of bio-crypto algorithms have been proposed, they have limited practical applicability because they lack of cancelability. Since biometrics are immutable, the users whose biometrics are stolen cannot use bio-crypto systems anymore. Cancelable biometric schemes are of cancelability; however, they are difficult to compromise the conflicts between the security and performance. By embedded a novel cancelable palmprint template, namely two dimensional (2D) Palmprint Phasor, the proposed palmprint cryptosystem overcomes the lack of cancelability in existing biometric cryptosystems. Besides, the authentication performance is enhanced when users have different tokens/keys. Furthermore, we develop a novel dual-key-binding cancelable palmprint cryptosystem to enhance the security and privacy of palmprint biometric. 2D Palmprint Phasor template is scrambled by the scrambling transformation based on the chaotic sequence that is generated by both the users token/key and strong key extracted from palmprint. Dual-key-binding scrambling not only has more robustness to resist against chosen plain text attack, but also enhances the secure requirement of non-invertibility. 2D Palmprint Phasor algorithm and dual-key-binding scrambling both increase the difficulty of adversarys statistical analysis. The experimental results and security analysis confirm the efficiency of the proposed scheme. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recently, cancelable biometrics emerged as one of the highly effective methods of template protection. The concept behind the cancelable biometrics or cancelability is a transformation of a biometric data or extracted feature into an alternative form, which cannot be used by the imposter or intruder easily, and can be revoked if compromised. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for template genera- tion in the context of situation awareness system in real and virtual applications. We develop a novel cancelable biomet- ric template generation algorithm utilizing random biometric fusion, random projection and selection. Proposed random cross-folding method generate cancelable biometric template from multiple biometric traits. We further validate the perfor- mance of the proposed algorithm using a virtual multimodal face and ear database.},

abstract = {Cognitive radio is a promising technology aiming to improve the utilization of the radio electromagnetic spectrum. A cognitive radio device uses general purpose computer processors that run radio applications software to perform signal processing. The use of this software enables the device to sense and understand its environment and actively change its mode of operation based on its observations. Unfortunately, this solution entails new security challenges. Our objective in this paper is to analyze the security issues of the main recent developments and architectures of cognitive radio networks. We present vulnerabilities inherent to those systems, identify novel types of abuse, classify attacks, and analyze their impact on the operation of cognitive radio-based systems. Moreover, we discuss and propose security solutions to mitigate such threats. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The Leap Motion Controller is a new device for hand gesture controlled user interfaces with declared sub-millimeter accuracy. However, up to this point its capabilities in real environments have not been analyzed. Therefore, this paper presents a first study of a Leap Motion Controller. The main focus of attention is on the evaluation of the accuracy and repeatability. For an appropriate evaluation, a novel experimental setup was developed making use of an industrial robot with a reference pen allowing a position accuracy of 0.2 mm. Thereby, a deviation between a desired 3D position and the average measured positions below 0.2 mm has been obtained for static setups and of 1.2 mm for dynamic setups. Using the conclusion of this analysis can improve the development of applications for the Leap Motion controller in the field of Human-Computer Interaction.},

abstract = {We present the results of an evaluation of the performance of the Leap Motion Controller with the aid of a professional, high-precision, fast motion tracking system. A set of static and dynamic measurements was performed with different numbers of tracking objects and configurations. For the static measurements, a plastic arm model simulating a human arm was used. A set of 37 reference locations was selected to cover the controller's sensory space. For the dynamic measurements, a special V-shaped tool, consisting of two tracking objects maintaining a constant distance between them, was created to simulate two human fingers. In the static scenario, the standard deviation was less than 0.5 mm. The linear correlation revealed a significant increase in the standard deviation when moving away from the controller. The results of the dynamic scenario revealed the inconsistent performance of the controller, with a significant drop in accuracy for samples taken more than 250 mm above the controller's surface. The Leap Motion Controller undoubtedly represents a revolutionary input device for gesture-based human-computer interaction; however, due to its rather limited sensory space and inconsistent sampling frequency, in its current configuration it cannot currently be used as a professional tracking system.},

abstract = {Advances in the field of Information Technology also make Information Security an inseparable part of it. In order to deal with security, Authentication plays an important role. This paper presents a review on the biometric authentication techniques and some future possibilities in this field. In biometrics, a human being needs to be identified based on some characteristic physiological parameters. A wide variety of systems require reliable personal recognition schemes to either confirm or determine the identity of an individual requesting their services. The purpose of such schemes is to ensure that the rendered services are accessed only by a legitimate user, and not anyone else. By using biometrics it is possible to confirm or establish an individual's identity. The position of biometrics in the current field of Security has been depicted in this work. We have also outlined opinions about the usability of biometric authentication systems, comparison between different techniques and their advantages and disadvantages in this paper.},

These objects are able to communicate and to interact among themselves, with end-users or other entities in the network. Entering the era of Internet of Things, the use of small, cheap and flexible computer hardware that allow end-user programming become present. One of them, considered in this paper, is the Raspberry Pi, fully customizable and programmable small computer board. Comparative analysis of its key elements and performances with some of current existing IoT prototype platforms have shown that despite few disadvantages, the Raspberry Pi remains an inexpensive computer with its very successfully usage in diverse range of research applications in IoT vision.},

@article{Jain2016,
abstract = {Biometric recognition refers to the automated recognition of individuals based on their biological and behavioral characteristics such as fingerprint, face, iris, and voice. The first scientific paper on automated fingerprint matching was published by Mitchell Trauring in the journal Nature in 1963. The first objective of this paper is to document the significant progress that has been achieved in the field of biometric recognition in the past 50 years since Trauring's landmark paper. This progress has enabled current state-of-the-art biometric systems to accurately recognize individuals based on biometric trait(s) acquired under controlled environmental conditions from cooperative users. Despite this progress, a number of challenging issues continue to inhibit the full potential of biometrics to automatically recognize humans. The second objective of this paper is to enlist such challenges, analyze the solutions proposed to overcome them, and highlight the research opportunities in this field. One of the foremost challenges is the design of robust algorithms for representing and matching biometric samples obtained from uncooperative subjects under unconstrained environmental conditions (e.g., recognizing faces in a crowd). In addition, fundamental questions such as the distinctiveness and persistence of biometric traits need greater attention. Problems related to the security of biometric data and robustness of the biometric system against spoofing and obfuscation attacks, also remain unsolved. Finally, larger system-level issues like usability, user privacy concerns, integration with the end application, and return on investment have not been adequately addressed. Unlocking the full potential of biometrics through inter-disciplinary research in the above areas will not only lead to widespread adoption of this promising technology, but will also result in wider user acceptance and societal impact.},
