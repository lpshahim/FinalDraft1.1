abstract = {Biometric analysis for identifying verification is becoming a widespread reality. It is a very challenging and tedious task to develop a biometric template protection scheme which is anonymous, revocable and noninvertible while maintaining decent performance. Cancellable biometrics is one of the best methods used to resolve this problem. In this paper, a new method called as BioHashing which follows the technique of cancellable biometrics in the fingerprint domain is proposed. This proposed method does not require the re-alignment of fingerprints as all the minutiae are translated into a pre-defined two dimensional space based on a reference minutia. After that, the proposed Biohashing method is used to enforce the one-way property (non-invertibility) of the biometric template. The proposed approach is very much resistant to minor translation error and rotation distortion. An Equal Error Rates (EER) of less than 1{\%} is achieved in this approach and performance of the approach is also significant.},

abstract = {Many transformation functions have been proposed for generating revocable or non-invertible biometric templates. However, their se-curity analysis either ignores the distribution of biometric features or uses inefficient feature matching. This usually leads to unrealistic estimates of security. In this paper we introduce a new measure of non-invertibility, called the Coverage-Effort (CE) curve which mea-sures the number of guesses (Effort) required by an adversary to re-cover a certain fraction (Coverage) of the original biometric data. In addition to utilizing the feature distribution, the CE curve allows esti-mation of security against partial recovery of biometric features. We analyze the CE curves obtained using different instances of a mix-ture of Gaussians based feature transform for fingerprint templates. Our analysis shows that knowledge of the fingerprint minutiae dis-tribution reduces the effort required to obtain a specified coverage.},

Biometric cryptosystems and cancelable biometrics represent emerging technologies of biometric tem- plate protection addressing these concerns and improving public confidence and acceptance of biometrics. In addition, biometric cryptosystems provide mechanisms for biometric-dependent key- release. In the last years a significant amount of approaches to both technologies have been published. A comprehensive survey of biometric cryptosystems and cancelable biometrics is presented. State-of-the-art approaches are reviewed based on which an in-depth discussion and an outlook to future prospects are given.},

abstract = {Recently, cancelable biometrics emerged as one of the highly effective methods of template protection. The concept behind the cancelable biometrics or cancelability is a transformation of a biometric data or extracted feature into an alternative form, which cannot be used by the imposter or intruder easily, and can be revoked if compromised. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for template genera- tion in the context of situation awareness system in real and virtual applications. We develop a novel cancelable biomet- ric template generation algorithm utilizing random biometric fusion, random projection and selection. Proposed random cross-folding method generate cancelable biometric template from multiple biometric traits. We further validate the perfor- mance of the proposed algorithm using a virtual multimodal face and ear database.},
