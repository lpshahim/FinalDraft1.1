abstract = {As organizations search for more secure authentication methods for$\backslash$nuser access, e-commerce. and other security applications, biometrics is$\backslash$ngaining increasing attention. But should your company use biometrics?$\backslash$nAnd, if so, which ones should you use and how do you choose them? There$\backslash$nis no one best biometric technology. Different applications require$\backslash$ndifferent biometrics. To select the right biometric for your situation,$\backslash$nyou will need to navigate through some complex vendor products and keep$\backslash$nan eye on future developments in technology and standards. Your options$\backslash$nhave never been more diverse. After years of research and development,$\backslash$nvendors now have several products to offer. Some are relatively$\backslash$nimmature, having only recently become commercially available, but even$\backslash$nthese can substantially improve your company's information security$\backslash$nposture. We briefly describe some emerging biometric technologies to$\backslash$nhelp guide your decision making},
