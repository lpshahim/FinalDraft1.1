"Make your parents proud, your enemies jealous and yourself happy." - Anon

I would like to dedicate this dissertation to my loving parents and wonderful sister. Without all of you, this would not have been possible. I am extremely blessed to have been given this opportunity. \\
To my late grandfather, and my namesake, I know you are looking down at me and smiling. Thank you for all of your love and support. I would have loved to celebrate this accomplishment with you over a whisky.\\ 
Lastly, to my Lord God Almighty for the continuous blessings, protection and guidance bestowed upon me. I am eternally grateful.\\
